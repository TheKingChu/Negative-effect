# Negative-effect
All the scripts that are for the VR i made at the start of the semester: Continuous movement, locomotion controller, hand presence, linerenderer settings, VRRig, XRoffset grab interactable. Other scripts that are on the XR Origin have been added at a later time, or changed out.

For the scripts I contributed on, I either added some more functionality or fixed bugs. The scripts I worked the most on were the Inventory and Watch.

For the solo scripts its stuff I worked on alone on them and tried to not touch them when they fully worked.

Other stuff I made for the project was UI elements, mostly canvases. Canvas_Timer, Canvas_MenuUI, LoadSave Panel, Inventory.
